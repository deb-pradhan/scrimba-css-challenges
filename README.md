# scrimba-css-challenges

A repo to learn and experiment CSS 

Short Git know how:
for updating changes:
1. status-> check what files have changed
2. add-> add the files that you want to upload(acts as the selector)
3. commit-> short note/message on what are you changing?
4. push-> push the changes to the remote github repo

What I've learned during these challenges:

ordered and unorederd list-> if we have a bunch of lists to add to the html file, we can just 
1. c&p them without the \<li> tag.
2. hold the alt button and point the cursor at the begining of each list and select all item.
3. add the \<li> tag!
what happens is, instead of having to write \<li> for each individual list, we can write the tag for all the list simultaneously!
4. repeat step 1-3 for adding the end tag \</li>
