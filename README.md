## What I've learned during these challenges

---

### challenge 1: Start

1. Created this repo for the challege and cloned it locally.
2. created an html files and add the necessary tags and doctype

---

### challenge 2: ordered and unorederd list-> if we have a bunch of lists to add to the html file, we can just

1. c&p them without the \<li> tag.
2. hold the alt button and point the cursor at the begining of each list and select all item.
3. add the \<li> tag!
what happens is, instead of having to write \<li> for each individual list, we can write the tag for all the list simultaneously!
4. repeat step 1-3 for adding the end tag \</li>
